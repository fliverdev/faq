        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </center>

    <p><strong>Q1. Is this like Ola or Uber?</strong></p>
    <p>No! Ola and Uber work on a one-to-one basis, because every Rider gets paired to a specific Driver. This means you need to wait for your Driver to reach you and can cause problems such as cancelation charges. Fliver simply gives information to
        Drivers as to where there is customer demand, so they can come to pick you.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2. Why is the app free?</strong></p>
    <p>One of Fliver's biggest advantages is that it's completely free for both Rickshaw Drivers and Riders. We built it so that it benefits everybody, and we intend to keep it that wayüòÅ</p>

    <p><strong>Q3. What about my privacy?</strong></p>
    <p>Fliver doesn't even ask for your name or email ID. We respect your privacy greatly, and all location data is completely anonymous. Read our <a href="https://fliverdev.github.io/privacy_policy/">privacy policy</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/fliverdev/rider">source
            code</a> if you don't believe us!</p>

    <p><strong>Q4. Why can't I delete markers?</strong></p>
    <p>Markers auto-delete after 15 minutes or if you start to move/get a Rickshaw. You can't manually delete a marker because it is meant to give Drivers an approximation of demand at a given time. If there are 5 markers in an area (eg. Railway
        Station), chances are there are a lot more people over there looking for a Rickshaw.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5. How can we carpool?</strong></p>
    <p>Chat functionality is coming soon, which will allow Riders in a hotspot to talk to each other and discuss carpooling together!</p>
