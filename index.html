    <h2>Fliver - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q1. Is this like Ola or Uber?</strong></p>
    <p>No! Ola and Uber work on a 1 to 1 basis, because every Rider gets paired to a specific Driver. This causes problems such as cancelation charges, waiting for your Driver to reach you, etc. Fliver only gives an idea to Drivers as to
        where there is customer demand.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2. Why is the app free/open source?</strong></p>
    <p>One of Fliver's biggest advantages is that it's free for Rickshaw Drivers and Riders, and nobody needs to pay anything extra to use it. We intend to keep it that way (as a public serviceüòÅ).</p>

    <p><strong>Q3. Why can't I delete markers?</strong></p>
    <p>Markers auto-delete after 15 minutes or if you start moving/get a Rickshaw. You can't manually delete a marker because it is meant to give Drivers an approximation of demand at a given time. If there are 3 markers in an area (eg. Railway Station), chances
        are there are a lot more people over there looking for Rickshaws.</p>

    <p><strong>Q4. Can we carpool with this?</strong></p>
    <p>Chat functionality is coming soon, which will allow Riders in a hotspot to talk to each other and discuss pooling together!</p>

    <p><strong>Q5. What about my privacy?</strong></p>
    <p>Fliver doesn't even ask for your name or email. We respect your privacy greatly. All location data is completely anonymous - read our <a href="https://fliverdev.github.io/privacy_policy/">privacy policy</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/fliverdev/rider">source
