        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </center>

    <p><strong>Q1. Is this like Ola or Uber?</strong></p>
    <p>No! Ola and Uber work on a one-to-one basis, because every Rider gets paired to a specific Driver. This means you need to wait for your Driver to arrive, and can create problems such as cancelation charges. Fliver simply provides information
        to
        Drivers as to where there is customer demand, so that they can come to pick you up.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2. Is there any way we can carpool?</strong></p>
    <p>Absolutely! Use the Hotspot Chat feature to talk to other Riders near you and make a plan to carpool. You can also use the Global Chat to warn others about traffic congestions and road accidents.</p>

    <p><strong>Q3. Is the app free?</strong></p>
    <p>Of course! One of Fliver's biggest advantages is that it's completely free for both Rickshaw Drivers and Riders. We built it so that it benefits everybody, and we intend to keep it that wayüòÅ</p>

    <p><strong>Q4. What about my privacy?</strong></p>
    <p>We respect your privacy greatly, and all location data is completely anonymous. Read our <a href="https://fliverdev.github.io/privacy_policy/">privacy policy</a> or check out the <a href="https://github.com/fliverdev/rider">source
            code</a> if you don't believe us!</p>

    <p><strong>Q5. Why can't I delete my marker?</strong></p>
    <p>Markers auto-delete after 15 minutes or if you get a Rickshaw. You can't manually delete a marker because it is meant to give Drivers an approximation of demand at a given time. Let's say that there are 5 markers in a given area
        (eg. Railway
        Station), chances are there are a lot more people over there looking for a Rickshaw.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6. What do Drivers see in their app?</strong></p>
    <p>You can download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.fliver.driver" target="_blank">Fliver Driver for Android</a> if you want to know how the whole system works.</p>
